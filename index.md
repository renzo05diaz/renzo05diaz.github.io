### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorites because it was my first time working with git and the terminal. I learned a lot from my partner Vance too. Lab 1 taught me the fundamentals of setting up and completing labs.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 part 1 & 2 were memorable favorites because it was the first time I had completely finished the lab on my own. I was able to test my knowledge and apply what I learned in and outside the classroom. This lab for was a good practice.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because I really love sandwiches. I was hungry the whole time coding this sandwich making program. I liked we were able to make it so that we can input any ingredient and it would output an assembled sentence!
